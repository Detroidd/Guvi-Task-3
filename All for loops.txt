
The for loop:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

// Result:
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4

The for loop above takes 3 statements within it:
let i = 0, which executes before the loop starts
i < 5, which is the condition for running the block of code within your loop
i++, which runs after each iteration of your loop.






The for in loop:

const student = {
    name: 'Monica',
    class: 7,
    age: 12
}

// using for...in
for ( let key in student ) {

    // display the properties
    console.log(`${key} => ${student[key]}`);
}

//Result:
//name => Monica
//class => 7
//age => 12

In the above program, the for...in loop is used to iterate over the student object and print all its properties.
The object key is assigned to the variable key.
student[key] is used to access the value of key.

In each iteration of the loop, a key is assigned to the key variable. The loop continues for all object properties.





The for of loop:

const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

for (const element of array1) {
  console.log(element);
}

// expected output: "a"
// expected output: "b"
// expected output: "c"

The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects
including: built-in String, Array, array-like objects, TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables.
It invokes a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property of the object.





The forEach loop:

Like the for loop, the forEach method can also achieve the same results:

const num = 4;
const arr = [0, 1, 2];

arr.forEach(num => {
  console.log(num);
});

// Result:
// 0
// 1
// 2
console.log(num);

// Result:
// 4

It is a newer way with lesser code to iterate over an array
The break statement cannot be used because of the callback function
The parameters are the iterator, index of item, and array to iterate.
